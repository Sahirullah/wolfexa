                  Virtual Library was born from the shared struggles of Pakistani university students 
                  who faced difficulties accessing quality study materials. Founded by a group of 
                  passionate students and educators, we recognized the gap between academic requirements 
                  and resource availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What started as a small collection of shared notes among friends has grown into 
                  Pakistan's largest digital library for educational resources. Today, we serve 
                  thousands of students across the country, helping them achieve academic success.
